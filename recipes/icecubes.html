        <p>They're cold, they're crunchy, and they can 
           chill a beverage. No freezer is complete
           without ice cubes in it!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ice cube tray</li>
            <li>water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with an empty ice cube tray</li>
            <li>Fill it with water from your sink</li>
            <li>While holding the tray, wonder about 
                the quality of your tap water</li>
            <li>Begin to worry about the prevalence of
                microplastics in the world today,
                as well as the negative health
                consequences of ingesting them</li>
            <li>Consider buying an expensive water 
                filtration system</li>
            <li>Realize that filtration system would likely
                have plastic components, too</li>
            <li>Decide that you'll just try not to think too
                much about it</li>
            <li>Place the filled ice cube tray in the freezer</li>
            <li>After three to four hours, enjoy your ice cubes!</li>    
        </ol>
