        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Do you have barely any appetite at all? Is frying an egg 
            your idea of gourmet cooking? Or do you just want to start small?   
        
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>a seasoned cast-iron skillet</li>
            <li>one egg</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with a clean skillet or frying pan</li>
            <li>Contemplate how a non-stick skillet would probably
                make this easier, but that teflon likely contains
                carcinogenic forever chemicals</li>
            <li>Grease the pan with a good amount of olive oil</li>
            <li>Turn the heat up to medium</li>
            <li>Wait for the oil to shimmer</li>
            <li>Wonder what "shimmering" oil even looks like, really</li>
            <li>Crack the egg into the oil</li>
            <li>For sunny-side-up eggs, simply wait  3-5 minutes, or until
                the yolk is just slightly runny</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Scrape the egg out of the pan, and realize that your
                cast-iron likely needs to be re-seasoned</li>    
        </ol>
