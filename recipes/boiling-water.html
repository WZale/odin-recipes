        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Do you need to make pasta? Maybe you're under a boil
            water advisory?  Or perhaps you'd like throw it up into freezing air to see what happens.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pot sized to hold the amount of water you need boiled</li>
            <li>water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with a clean, empty pot</li>
            <li>Fill it with water from your sink</li>
            <li>While holding the pot, ask yourself why you
                know how to google things, but not how to boil
                water</li>
            <li>Lose track of time while pondering this question
                and fill the pot up until it is unnecessarily full
            </li>
            <li>Struggle to lift the pot out of the sink
                and over to the stove without spilling any water
            </li>
            <li>Turn the heat under the pot to high</li>
            <li>Realize that a watched pot never boils, but that
                it will be difficult to know if the water is boiling without being able to see it
            </li>
            <li>Decide to avoid this problem by simply standing there and waiting to <em>hear</em> the water boil</li>
            <li>Place a lid on the pot to decrease the time needed to boil</li>    
        </ol>
